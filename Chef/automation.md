IDEMPOTENCY and CONVERGENCE

Idempotence task no matter if glass fulled water or not it would be brting full glass of water.
Idempotence, in programming and mathematics, is a property of some operations such that no matter how many times you execute them, you achieve the same result. In programming, idempotence can be a property of many different code elements, including functions, methods, requests and statements.Idempotent operations produce the same result even when the operation is repeated many times. The result of the 2nd, 3rd, and 1,000th repeat of the operation will return exactly the same result as the 1st time.

\The convergence of different ideas, groups, or societies is the process by which they stop being different and become more similar.
