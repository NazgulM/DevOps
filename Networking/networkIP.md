Corporate Datacenter

IPV4 Address - built based on binary numbers 192(11000000 - octet 8 bits). 192(10101000 - octet 8 bits). 100(01100100- octet 8 bits). 1 (00000001 - octet 8 bites)

all IPv4 - starts from 0
0. 0. 0. 0 - 255.255.255.255

00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000(0.0.0.0)

Public and private IP

Puyblic IP = Internet
54.86.23.90 e.g
Private IP = for local network design 
192.168.1.10

class c 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
 any IP in this range would be in class c, private class c
192.168.10.12

Class B 172.16.0.0- 172.31.255.255
172.16.12.30
172.20.19.68

Class A 10.0.0.0- 10.255.255.255
