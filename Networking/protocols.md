Protocols

In the networking and communication area, a protocol is the formal soecification that defines the procedures to communicate between center and receiving data. Protocols define the format, timing sequence, and error checking.

TCP 
Reliable protocol
connection Oriented 
Like HTTP, FTP, HTTPS
Perform three ways handshake
Provision for error detection and retransmittion
Most apllication use TCP for reliable and guaranteed transmission

UDP
Unreliable protocol
Much faster than TCP
Connectionless
No acknowledgement waits
No proper sequencing odf data units
Suitable for apllications where speed matters more than reliability
DNS, DHCP, TFTP, ARP, RARP

Protocols have default port number
