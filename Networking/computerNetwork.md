Computer Network is a communication betweent two or more network interfaces.
Components of Computer Network:

1. Two or more computer/devices
2. Cables as links between two computers
3. A network interfacing card (NIC) on each
4. Computer
5. Switches to connect multiple network interfaces together
6. Routers to connect multiple network together
7. Software called operating system (OS)

OSI Model:
People around the world uses computer network to communicate each other.

For Worldwide data communication, systems must be developed which are compatible across all devices.

There should be standard communication methods and devices.
ISO (International Organization of Standartization) has developed this standard.

OSI MODEL _ Open System Interconnection 
ISO-OSI Model is a seven layer architecture (1. physical, 2. data link, 3.network, 4.transport, 5.session, 6. presentation, 7.application) developed in 1984.

The basic elements of a layered model are : services, protocols, interfaces(communication between layers).

1. Physical layer - responsible for actual connection to devices, for example cabels, data unit bits.Media, sygnal and binary transmission.
2. Data link- (MAC and LLC) physical addresing, make sure transfer is error free  from one note to another, data is frames, MAC address, then data presented to network
3. Network (Path determination, transmission data from one note to other, it works on IP address, data is packets. 
4.Transport - end to end conncetions, reliability, responsible to end to end delivery complete messages, data is segments.
5. Session- Interhost communication, responsible for security, maintainance of app.
Layer 1 - hub
Layer2 - switches
Layer3 - router, firewall
Layer 4 -gateways
Layer 5, 6, 7 - web server, mail server, browser, mail client

Physical - transmit bits over a medium, cables, wifi conncetion
Data link - organizes bits into frames, 
Network- packets travel from source to destination, to provide internet working.
Transport - provide reliable process-to process message delivery, error recovery
Session - Establish, manage and terminate sessions.
Prersentation -  Translaty, encrypt and compress data, 
Application - allow access to network resources.
