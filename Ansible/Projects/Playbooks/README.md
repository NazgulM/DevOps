# Ansible playbooks

1. Create two VMs in Digital Ocean - one for controller another for node1 machine
2. In controller node have to create ssh key for connecting to node1

```
cd .ssh
ssh-keygen
cat id_rsa.pub 
# copy to cd .ssh, vi authorized_keys of node 1 machine
then try to ssh node1Ip
```

3; Install ansible to both machines

```
sudo yum install epel-release -y
sudo yum update â€“y
sudo yum install ansible -y
In both /etc/ansible/hosts add
ansibleController IP
[webservers]
node1IPAddress
```

4; Create firstplay.yaml file for installing java

```
---
 - name: this is my first playbook
   hosts: all
   tasks: 
     - name: install java
       yum:
        name: java
        state: latest
run
ansible-playbook firstplay.yaml -i 161.35.52.15,
# for installing java in node1 host
```

## Ansible Inventory

It is a collection of managed hosts we want to manage with Ansible for various automation and configuration

```
mail.example.com

[webservers]
foo.example.com
bar.example.com

[dbservers]
one.example.com
two.example.com
three.example.com
```

Can vi /etc/ansible/hosts
delete all content in this hosts file
Can put machine details directly, put ipAddress

can put ipAddress of node1 machine in inventory.txt

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt firstplay.yaml
```

5; Install jenkins with Docker

```
